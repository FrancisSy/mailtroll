```

or

python3 mailtroll.py user.email "recipient.email(s)" count
```
where the user.email flag is the user's email, the
recipient.email is the recipient email address or addresses, and the 
count is the number of times you want to spam the account. 
Place all recipeint emails inside a string quote.

## Things to know  
When user runs into the bad credentials error, just 
follow this [link](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255)
to allow third party access.

and that may be bad but you're a troll and that's also bad so why does it matter?
